# About Me

I am a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of South Dakota, set to graduate in December 2024. My background includes seven months as a network engineer at Cognizant, where I focused on maintaining and managing servers.

My technical skill set spans across Java, Data Structures, Algorithms, MySQL, and frontend technologies. I have a passion for developing user-friendly, efficient, and scalable software solutions. Currently, I am seeking opportunities for a Summer 2024 internship in Software Development or as a FullStack Developer.

I am enthusiastic about contributing to impactful projects, particularly in Java development or frontend/backend development roles, and have a keen interest in Android and iOS mobile development. I look forward to connecting and collaborating with professionals who share my passion for technology and innovation.
